### Dynamic sub-swarm particle swarm optimization
On the basis of analyzing the particle swarm optimization and introducing the idea of sub-swarms，
a particle swarm optimization algorithm with dynamic sub—swarms(DPSO)is proposed．
The particle swarm is divided into two or more sub—swarms according to the fitness value during searching． 
Then，the sub—swarms use different searching strategy，respectively． The best fitness output value is obtained．
The DPSO algorithm is used to solve the optimization problems of several widely used test functions，and
results indicate that the DPSO has powerful ability of 910bal searching．
The DPSO algorithm is also applied to construct a practical soft—sensor of gasoline endpoint of delayed coking plant．
The model haseffective generalization performance and higher precision．
